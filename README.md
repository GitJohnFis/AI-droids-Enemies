## 2. Module Breakdown

### a. **Game Engine (main.py)**
- Initializes and manages the game loop.
- Handles global state, event polling, object spawning, and orchestration.
- Calls update and draw methods for all game entities.

### b. **Player Ship (player.py)**
- Handles user input, movement, and firing bullets.
- Tracks health, score, and status.
- Detects collisions with asteroids, enemy bullets, and enemy ships.

### c. **Asteroids (asteroid.py)**
- Randomly generated with various sizes, speeds, and trajectories.
- Moves autonomously and wraps around screen edges.
- Detects collisions with player, enemy ships, and projectiles.

### d. **Enemy Ships (enemy.py)**
- Autonomous AI agents:
    - Move toward player using vector math.
    - Avoid asteroids (basic obstacle avoidance).
    - Fire projectiles with cooldown logic.
    - Can be extended to multiple types (e.g. boss, fast, swarm).
- Each manages its own bullets/projectiles.

### e. **Projectiles (bullet.py)**
- Includes both player and enemy bullets.
- Moves in a specified direction with constant speed.
- Tracks its own lifetime and collision status.

### f. **Collision System (utils.py / inside main.py)**
- Checks overlap between all relevant game entities:
    - Player vs. asteroid, enemy, or bullet.
    - Enemy vs. asteroid or player bullet.
    - Bullet vs. asteroid or ship.
- Handles resulting actions (damage, destruction, scoring).

### g. **Power-ups (powerup.py, optional)**
- Spawned on certain events (e.g. asteroid or enemy destruction).
- Provides temporary boosts (shield, rapid fire, etc.).

### h. **Assets (assets/)**
- Contains graphics, sound effects, and fonts.

## 8. Notes

- Use Pygameâ€™s rect/circle collision methods for simplicity.
- Store all dynamic entities (asteroids, enemies, bullets) in lists for easy update/removal.
- Keep logic for each entity self-contained for maintainability.
- Tune AI parameters (speed, cooldown, avoidance strength) for fun gameplay.
